/Q23=> . Body mass index(BMI) is calculated as follows:

    - Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
    - Obese: BMI is 30 or more*/

function checkBmi(weight , height){
    const bmi = (Math.round((weight / height ** 2) * 10)) / 10;
    console.log(`your bmi is ${bmi}`)

    if( bmi < 18.5){
        console.log("You are underweight");
    }else if (bmi>=18.5 && bmi <=24.9){
        console.log("you weight is normal , keep it up, well done");
    }else if ( bmi > 24.9 && bmi <=29.9){
        console.log("You are under weight , need to do running");

    }else {
        console.log("you are obese, join gym immediatly , as soon as possilble");
    }
}
